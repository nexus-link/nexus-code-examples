# BusinessApi

This is a template for a Business Api as described in the [Business API template tutorial](https://docs.nexus.link/docs/business-api-template-csharp-tutorial).

It also adds some extra things here that are very common, but are not mandatory:
- Logging to Stackify
- Unit test projects

It also has example code for an invoicing capability.
